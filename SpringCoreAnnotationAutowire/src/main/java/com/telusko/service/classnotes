Stereotype Annotations
Any annotation which will be applied to the class are called as Stereotype Annotations

@Componenet(if you apply this annotation to any class to create the bean of this classs)
Example

@Component
class Alpha//if nothing is mentioned then beanid is alpha or else just say @Component("a")
{

}

@service  ->@Component+service layer
@Repository ->@Component+repo layer(DB)
@controller ->@Component +weblayer (html+jsp)
@RestController ->@Component+angular and react
@Configuration ->@Component+configurations

@Bean(it is not streotype)-->it is applied at method level

we don't have @qualifer at the consturctor
